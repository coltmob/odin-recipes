    <h2><strong>Abbot's Pizza Company's Famous Salad Pizza</strong></h2>
    <p><strong>Abbot Pizza Company</strong> is admired by locals, but for the rest of us, 
        this neighborhood joint is pretty unheard of. With fan favorites like the Five Onion made with 
        five different onions, three cheeses, and olive pestos sauce to Popeye's 
        Chicken made with tequila lime marinated chicken, cheese, veggies and garlic pesto - 
        sticking to your New Year's diet can be tricky.
        (Did we mention that Abbot's crusts come in bagel-like varieties? Choose between onion, 
        poppy, garlic, hot pepper, sesame, and everything!)</p>
    <p><strong>What's inside?</strong> Mozzarella Cheese and Onion Baked Crust, 
        A Thin Layer Of Sour Cream, Then Topped With A Healthy Layer Of Chopped Salad, 
        Feta Cheese And Tomatoes Sprinkled On Top, Drizzled With Our House Lemon-Olive Oil Dressing, 
        Covered With A Layer Of Fresh Avocados</p>
